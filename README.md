Spotify is testing a new subscription called Premium Duo that offers two Premium subscriptions for two people who live in the same house at a discounted price. With Premium Duo, the users still have their own separate Spotify accounts. Duo also introduces a new playlist, the Duo Mix, combining both peoplesâ€™ music preferences into one playlist.
