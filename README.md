### A Music Analyzer giving suggestions on what my partner may like from my Spotify playlists based on Listening Histories and Song Features

The idea here comes partly from the 'new' Spotify's Premium Duo service. I am curious to know what my partner may like from the songs I listened to in general. (A sad note: I always got complained about my music choice!)

<br>Spotify is testing a new subscription called Premium Duo that offers two Premium subscriptions for two people living in the same house at a discounted price. With Premium Duo, the users still have their own separate Spotify accounts. Duo also introduces a new playlist, the Duo Mix, combining the two personsâ€™ music preferences into one. So far, my partner doesn't seem to quite enjoy Spotify's suggestions in the new playlist. 

Let me have a go and see if I can do a better job?!





#### Acknowledgement:

There are different song recommendation algorithms out there and I think this one by <a href="https://github.com/isacmlee/song-recommender">isaclee</a> is really well thought and easily extendable. My analysis here adopts and expands on his work. Check out <a href="https://github.com/isacmlee/song-recommender">isaclee</a>'s repo - he has also created a script that enables automation of playlist creation (converting .csv song list into a Spotify playlist).
